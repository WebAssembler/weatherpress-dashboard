### Note
This plugin is being actively development as part of a blog post that I am currently writing for Atomic Smash. 

The blog post explains how to create a custom dashboard widget in Wordpress and is intended for developers who are comfortable creating plugins. The plugin will fetch weather information from a weather API (openweathermap), using Guzzle.

When I've finished the blog post, I will update the code and markdown, proving clear set up instructions.
